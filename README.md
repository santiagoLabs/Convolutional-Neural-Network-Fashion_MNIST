The model uses a cross entropy loss function and SGD as optimisation method. Weights are initialized using the Xavier normal initialization. 

Trained the model for 50 epochs with the following activation functions: Sigmoid, reLU and Tanh.

<b>Results:</b>
<b>Activation Function: Tanh
Learning rate: 0.1<br>
